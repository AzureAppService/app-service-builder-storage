# FileVault: App Service Builder + Azure Blob Storage

This integration is not in the Portal template gallery; fork the canonical repository and follow the manual resource setup below.

A React file browser with a Node.js 24/Express backend for **private Azure Blob
Storage**. Upload, list, filter loaded files, preview raster images, download, and
delete files without a database, storage account key, connection string, SAS, or
browser-side Azure token.

This is a DEV/TEST sample for App Service Builder public preview, adapted from
the Embr FileVault template. Builder and Blob Storage are independent resources.
The old built-in storage proxy and its API keys are not used.

![Hosted FileVault browser with synthetic files](docs/assets/filevault-hosted-browser.png)

The screenshots show the actual Builder-hosted app in Microsoft Edge, using its
system-assigned managed identity against a real private Azure container:
[upload queue](docs/assets/filevault-hosted-upload.png) and
[private image preview](docs/assets/filevault-hosted-preview.png).
Required Entra sign-in and an explicit tester allowlist protected the test app.
Both synthetic files were downloaded with byte-exact comparisons, then deleted.

**Qualification:** hosted list, upload, pagination, preview, download and delete
passed in East US 2 on November 3, 2026. The separately approved temporary ZIP
test qualified hosted source and managed-identity operations, **not GitHub-source
runtime activation or West US 2 deployment**. Published deployment instructions
below use GitHub source only. A separate internal GitHub-source attempt built a
ready version but failed activation with `AppRuntimeIdentityMismatch`; it is not
additional hosted functional evidence.
See [the qualification record](docs/qualification.json) for the deployed source
and exact scope. This is not production-readiness or support for every preview
target; a successful `/api/health` check alone does not prove storage access.

Earlier [local browser](docs/assets/filevault-browser.png),
[upload](docs/assets/filevault-upload.png) and
[preview](docs/assets/filevault-preview.png) captures are retained separately.
Those used local developer credentials, not hosted managed identity.

## Architecture and boundaries

The browser calls same-origin `/api/files`. Express uses the official
`@azure/storage-blob` SDK. Hosted code uses `ManagedIdentityCredential`
(system-assigned by default; `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` selects a user-assigned identity).
Local development uses `DefaultAzureCredential`, including `az login`.
Only the backend reads these configuration values.

The container is private and Shared Key authentication is disabled. The sample
creates a new account with an HTTPS **public network endpoint**, authenticated
through Entra RBAC: public network reachability is not public blob access.
Builder currently has no customer VNet integration or stable outbound IP; a
private endpoint alone cannot connect it to your network. Do not weaken an
existing account's firewall to run this sample. If policy requires private-only
networking, this topology is not suitable.

Builder **Required sign-in** and explicit allowed identities protect the app.
All allowed visitors share this sample's container and can read/write/delete
every file; it is not a multi-tenant vault. The backend fails closed when
Builder's verified identity header is missing. It trusts those headers only
behind Builder, which strips client-supplied copies. Do not expose this backend
directly through another hosting provider without independent authentication.
`APP_ACCESS_MODE=local` disables visitor authentication only on a server bound
to `127.0.0.1`; never set it in Builder.

Uploads are multipart, one file per request, at most 10 MiB. The UI queues at
most 20 files and uploads sequentially. UUID-prefixed names avoid overwrites.
List pages contain at most 100 files with an opaque continuation token.
Statistics/filtering describe loaded pages, not the whole account. Download
streams through the backend. Only PNG/JPEG/GIF/WebP/AVIF can preview inline;
SVG, HTML and other active content are attachments with `nosniff` and a sandbox
policy. Mutations require a same-origin custom request header, with no CORS
enabled. Storage operations have a 30-second deadline and bounded SDK retries.
This sample does not include antivirus scanning, quotas, per-user ownership,
retention, or production rate limiting.

## Prerequisites

- Azure subscription authorized for Builder in **West US 2 (`westus2`)**, the
  only public customer region. Verify `Microsoft.Web/builderApps` access and
  **Node.js 24 compute activation** for your selected target; a successful
  Node build is not proof of target activation support.
- Azure CLI with Bicep, Node.js 24 and npm for local development.
- Permission to provision storage and a resource group; Owner, Role Based
  Access Control Administrator, or equivalent to assign container data roles.
  Management-plane Contributor alone does not grant blob data access.
- A GitHub copy in your account with the root `builder.yaml`, connected branch,
  and approved Builder GitHub App installation. Organization repositories may
  require organization/SSO approval.

Use your subscription explicitly in **every Azure command**. Shell placeholders
below refer only to your newly created test resources; do not reuse or modify
production resources.

Fork [this repository](https://github.com/AzureAppService/app-service-builder-storage)
into your GitHub account, then clone your copy and run the following steps from
its root. Keep the root `builder.yaml` and both component directories together:

```bash
git clone "https://github.com/<your-account>/app-service-builder-storage.git"
cd app-service-builder-storage
```

## 1. Provision the Blob dependency

```bash
SUBSCRIPTION="<your-approved-devtest-subscription-id>"
TENANT="<your-tenant-id>"
RG="<new-test-resource-group>"
STORAGE="<globally-unique-3-to-24-lowercase-alphanumeric-name>"
STORAGE_LOCATION=westus2

az login --tenant "$TENANT"
az group create --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --name "$RG" --location "$STORAGE_LOCATION"
az deployment group create --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --resource-group "$RG" \
  --name filevault-storage --template-file infra/main.bicep \
  --parameters storageAccountName="$STORAGE" location="$STORAGE_LOCATION"
```

`infra/main.bicep` creates only Standard_LRS StorageV2/Hot and its private
`filevault` container, with TLS 1.2+, HTTPS-only, no anonymous blobs, and no
Shared Key access. No App Service plan or Builder App is created by this
dependency template. Capture the deployment outputs:

```bash
az deployment group show --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --resource-group "$RG" \
  --name filevault-storage --query properties.outputs -o json
```

`blobEndpoint` is `https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/`.
`containerScope` ends with `/blobServices/default/containers/filevault`.
Keep the exact resource IDs in your cleanup inventory.

## 2. Run locally against Azure

Grant only your developer's user principal container access:

```bash
DEVELOPER_OBJECT_ID=$(az ad signed-in-user show --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --query id -o tsv)
az deployment group create --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --resource-group "$RG" \
  --name filevault-developer-role --template-file infra/role.bicep \
  --parameters storageAccountName="$STORAGE" principalId="$DEVELOPER_OBJECT_ID" principalType=User

export AZURE_STORAGE_BLOB_ENDPOINT="https://$STORAGE.blob.core.windows.net/"
export AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER=filevault
export APP_ACCESS_MODE=local
export PORT=8080
unset AZURE_CLIENT_ID
npm ci
npm run install:components
npm test
npm run dev
```

Open the Vite URL printed by the command (normally `http://127.0.0.1:5173`).
The Vite proxy sends `/api` to `127.0.0.1:8080`; Azure credentials remain in
the Node process. `.env.example` documents settings but the app does not
automatically load `.env`; export them in your shell. Use an otherwise clean
Azure environment so `DefaultAzureCredential` does not select an unintended
service principal before Azure CLI credentials.

For a local single-server preview, use `npm run build && npm start` and browse
`http://127.0.0.1:8080`. `npm run verify:storage` performs a real API
read/upload/list/byte-exact-download/delete and checks that its test blob is gone.
It defaults to this local origin; this **does not qualify hosted managed identity**.
RBAC propagation can take several minutes: wait and retry, never add account
keys or widen roles to work around a 403.

## 3. Publish and configure Builder

Commit the source, lockfile and root manifest to your own connected GitHub
branch. Do not publish changes back to the legacy Embr template. Builder reads
committed remote source, not your local working tree.

In [App Service Builder Portal](https://builder.appservice.azure.com/):

1. Create an app from your repository using **Let Builder handle it**. Authorize
   only that repository for the Builder GitHub App, including organization/SSO
   approvals when required. Keep the source folder at repository root (`.`).
2. Select your explicitly approved subscription, test resource group and
   **West US 2 (`westus2`)**, the only public customer region. Provision Storage
   there as shown above, and verify Node.js 24 compute support for your
   subscription.
3. On **Identity**, turn on the system-assigned managed identity and select
   **Save and deploy**. On **Authentication**, use **Required** sign-in and Entra
   **Limit to specific identities**, with your tenant ID plus explicit allowed
   user object IDs, then **Save**. Use Builder's managed Entra application.
   A tenant-only rule allows everyone in that directory.
4. In Variables, set the storage endpoint/container from the Bicep outputs.
   Keep `APP_ACCESS_MODE=builder` or omit it, and leave `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` unset
   for system-assigned identity. Do not add a `VITE_` credential variable.
5. Save settings and deploy a new version. On Identity, record the app's
   **principal ID**, then grant the role below and verify actual operations.

| Runtime setting | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_BLOB_ENDPOINT` | `https://<account>.blob.core.windows.net/` |
| `AZURE_STORAGE_CONTAINER` | `filevault` |
| `APP_ACCESS_MODE` | `builder` (default); never `local` in Builder |
| `AZURE_CLIENT_ID` | Unset for system identity; client ID for selected user identity |
| `PORT` | `8080` from manifest |

`builder.yaml` uses the maintained `components` schema with independent build
roots and one shared public origin:

| Component | Source root | Public mount | Build output/startup |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `frontend` | `client/` | `/` | Vite static assets under `$DESTINATION_DIR/dist` |
| `api` | `server/` | `/api` | Generic Node.js `"24"` web output; `node index.js`, port 8080, `/api/health` returns 200 |

Each component has its own package manifest and lockfile. Only `client/`
contains Vite/React dependencies and the Vite config. The API root contains only
the Azure SDK/Express/Multer dependencies, so it is classified as a Node server,
not Vite. Vite components cannot declare `role: web` or `run`; a custom build
does not override that framework classification. Keep frontend and server
dependencies separate rather than combining them in a root package.

The client build stages only browser assets. The API build stages its startup,
routes, package manifests and production dependencies under its own
`$DESTINATION_DIR`. Builder forwards the `/api` prefix unchanged; the app
implements `/api/files` and `/api/health` explicitly. The root package/scripts
are local orchestration only, not a deployed component. To stage both outputs
locally after installing dependencies:

```bash
DESTINATION_DIR="$PWD/.builder-output" npm run build:builder
# Static web root: .builder-output/client/dist
# API startup:    .builder-output/server/index.js
```

The Dockerfile also builds the isolated client dependencies and installs only
server runtime dependencies in its final Node image. For local single-server
preview, Express can serve `client/dist`; hosted Builder uses the separate static
component instead. Visitor authentication is still required when using Builder
mode. There are no YAML identity, authentication, linked-service or secret fields.

## 4. Grant the app container access

```bash
APP_PRINCIPAL_ID="<system-assigned-identity-principal-id-from-Builder>"
az deployment group create --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --resource-group "$RG" \
  --name filevault-app-role --template-file infra/role.bicep \
  --parameters storageAccountName="$STORAGE" principalId="$APP_PRINCIPAL_ID"
```

The template grants **Storage Blob Data Contributor**
(`ba92f5b4-2d11-453d-a403-e96b0029c9fe`) only at the private container scope.
It does not grant subscription/RG/storage-account-wide data access and does not
change a firewall. The principal ID is an object ID, not the application's
client ID. No SDK account/container creation is performed at runtime.

### User-assigned identity alternative

```bash
az identity create --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --resource-group "$RG" \
  --name "<new-filevault-identity>" --location "$STORAGE_LOCATION"
```

Record the returned resource ID, principal ID and client ID separately. On
Builder's Identity page, attach that **resource ID** and select **Set as
AZURE_CLIENT_ID**, then **Save and deploy**. Grant the role above to the identity's
**principal ID**. The SDK selects it using the **client ID**, not the resource ID.
Identity-only changes redeploy retained output; variable changes capture a new
version. Confirm the running deployment completed before testing. User-assigned
identities are not deleted when the app is deleted.

## 5. Qualify the deployed sample and capture evidence

Wait for a successful deployment and confirm the source commit/active version.
Use the actual runtime URL returned by Builder:

1. Open it in Microsoft Edge. Signed-out access must require sign-in; only
   configured allowed identities should reach the file browser. `/api/health`
   checks process startup, not storage.
2. Sign in, refresh the list, and upload a small non-sensitive PNG and text file.
   Confirm both are listed, preview the PNG, and download the text file with a
   byte-for-byte comparison against the original.
3. Delete those test files and refresh to confirm they are absent. Check failed
   uploads, invalid/oversize requests and visible storage-permission errors.
4. Record the runtime URL, source commit, active version, identity type, role
   scope and sanitized operation results. Capture screenshots of the real file
   browser, upload, and preview without account tokens, private data or portal
   account details. Store sanitized captures under `docs/assets/`.

Use the signed-in browser for hosted checks; keep session cookies and tokens
inside that browser. Do not export them into a script or disable Required
sign-in to run a verifier. The local `npm run verify:storage` helper starts with
a bounded read, writes one uniquely named synthetic file, compares the downloaded
bytes, deletes it and verifies its absence. It prints only sanitized operation
outcomes. Redirects/401/403 are failures, not success.
Unit tests use an injected storage client; they do not prove Azure reachability.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Action |
| --- | --- |
| Missing/invalid configuration | Export the endpoint/container locally or save them as Builder variables; no SAS/query/path is accepted in the endpoint. |
| 401 from FileVault | Configure Required Builder sign-in and use an allowed visitor. Never forge trusted identity headers or enable local mode in Builder. |
| Storage 503 / underlying 401 or 403 | Confirm deployed identity, principal ID, container role, RBAC propagation and network reachability separately; inspect sanitized server logs. |
| Works locally, not hosted | Local Azure CLI and hosted managed identity are different principals. Verify hosted RBAC and identity deployment, not just local credentials. |
| Unsupported Node activation | Confirm Node.js 24 availability for the selected target. Stop; do not repeatedly deploy the same unsupported compute output. |
| `AppRuntimeIdentityMismatch` | Preserve the deployment ID and contact Builder support for runtime binding diagnosis. A ready build is not activation success; do not replace the identity, widen roles, or blindly retry. |
| Old endpoint or identity selection | Variable edits require a new version; retained versions keep historical variables. Check active version. |
| Upload 413 | Maximum size is exactly 10 MiB per file. Split or reduce the file; the UI also limits each queue to 20 files. |
| Empty/missing files | Check configured account/container and page token; UI filtering covers loaded pages only. Missing containers return 404 instead of being created at runtime. |
| Dependency timeout | Check DNS/TLS and network policy. The sample aborts storage operations after 30 seconds; do not relax an existing firewall. |
| Deployment fails before build | Confirm root `builder.yaml`, current remote commit, GitHub App repository access and organization/SSO authorization. |
| Vite component rejects `role: web` or `run` | Keep Vite dependencies/config in the static `client` root and Express in the generic Node `server` root. A custom build command does not override framework detection. |

## Costs and cleanup

Blob Storage incurs capacity, requests and outbound-transfer charges; Builder
preview pricing/availability is separate and can change. Standard_LRS/Hot is
economical for small disposable files but not highly available disaster recovery.
There is no database, premium storage, VNet, or telemetry workspace to pay for.
Do not leave test apps/files running indefinitely.

Delete only resources/role assignments created for this exercise after reviewing
the recorded IDs and confirming no other samples reuse them:

```bash
# Inventory first. Do not delete a shared group containing other samples.
az resource list --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --resource-group "$RG" -o table
# Delete the test Builder app using Portal and its normal confirmation.
# Delete recorded sample-only role assignments, then the sample storage account:
az role assignment delete --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --ids "<recorded-role-assignment-id>"
az storage account delete --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --resource-group "$RG" --name "$STORAGE"
# Only if you created the optional sample identity:
az identity delete --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --resource-group "$RG" --name "<new-filevault-identity>"
# Delete the RG only after every owner confirms it is disposable:
az group delete --subscription "$SUBSCRIPTION" --name "$RG"
```

Deletion is destructive. App deletion does not delete storage, user-assigned
identities, role assignments or the GitHub copy. Review cleanup rather than
automating deletion in a deployment script.
